trampling-on-ghosts	1	full	9:30	18:30	Trampling on Ghosts: Hauntology and Permadeath	"This talk is an attempt to challenge the ways in which roguelikes handle death, reincarnation, and the way in which the player's failures ""haunt"" the game's environments. We'll be looking at this through the lens of ""hauntology"", a cultural theory that deals in cycles of nostalgia and the ghosts that it creates, and looking at how this might apply to roguelites such as Inscryption and Returnal. I promise it won't be quite as morbid as it sounds."	harry-solomons
control-the-controller	2	lightning	9:30	18:30	Who Controls the Controller? Thinking about physical player interactions outside a digital game	Ever considered how the way you press a button can change your gaming experience? In this talk, I'll share my perspective as someone from an industrial design background overthinking the weird world of alternative controller (or alt.ctrl) games. Here the controller is as much a part of the game as what is in the screen. We’ll explore how controls like making funny faces, rocking on a chair, or shoveling golf balls, can extend the boundaries of a game experience and how the interaction changes the relationship between player and game. We'll also consider how these principles could apply to traditional games, challenging control conventions to offer a more varied and engaging experience	yong-zhen-zhou
ac-meet-rc	2	lightning	9:45	18:45	Animal Crossing meets Roguelite Dungeon Crawler: The surprising genre mixture behind Grimoire Groves	During the peak of the Covid pandemic, a small indie game studio from Switzerland set out to take their favorite genre - roguelite dungeon crawlers - and transfer it into a cozy, colorful and comforting world. After all, the real world out there is already scary enough, so at least our favorite video games should be a place we want to escape to, right? Over the past four years, this vision manifested itself in Grimoire Groves, a roguelite game about witches, friendship, mythical creatures and growing plants. The talk tackles the surprising similarities between farming/life sims and roguelite dungeon crawlers by explaining how Grimoire Groves mixes cute Animal Crossing-like villagers and friendship systems with dungeon crawler action mechanics.	tabea-iseli
enhancing-narrative	1	full	10:00	19:00	Enhancing Narrative Through Randomness and Complications	Discover how randomness, particularly through oracles and partial successes, can transform game narratives from predictable paths into dynamic, unique stories. This talk will explore how random elements can drive compelling plotlines without relying on predefined lore, and how diverse complications can turn failures into opportunities for narrative branching. Through practical examples and case studies, we'll explore how structured randomness can lead to emergent storytelling that surprises both players and creators alike.	cezar-capacle
big-wishes	2	lightning	10:00	19:00	100'000 wishlists in 3 months - Weird roguelikes are taking over the world	The roguelike genre continues to ride a massive wave of popularity. New games are added to a long list of releases on a daily basis, leaving the market fairly crowded. However, as the genre matures, more and more sub-genres are emerging. Inspired by the success of Peglin, our studio decided to take a swing at putting together a demo for a 'physics rougelike', combining classic mechanics of the genre with the arcady physics of a claw machine. We named the 'Dungeon Clawler' and it has managed to earn 100k+ wishlists in its first 3 months on Steam. This talk goes into detail on how the game was designed and marketed.	philomena-schwab
going-legit	2	full	10:15	19:15	Going legit with DotA: How to transform a thousand authors into four	In 2015 Lilith games contests a complaint for copyright infringement sent to them by Valve. The dispute is over Defense of the Ancients (DotA) the multi million dollar E-sports and casual play intellectual property. This contesting escalates into a multi year lawsuit in which Lilith games challenges Valve and Blizzards claim to DotA, trying to claim it as a ’collective work’, pressuring these mega companies to frantically try and establish a ’'legitimate'' claim to their intellectual property. And in the process transforming the games formerly thousands of authors into four.   All this of course being in opposition to DotA’s nature – as a collective work.  Lets dive into how Valve successfully transformed the narrative of DotA’s development to the detriment of 99% of it’s authors and community and how we can prepare ourselves for ownership heists like these.  I suggest starting by looking to the practices of many a roguelike developer.	kaysa-konopljak
keeping-art	1	lightning	10:30	19:30	Keeping Art Direction interesting in a procedurally generated world	One of the challenges for procedurally generated levels is how to create variety and encourage exploration, while maintaining efficiency in the art asset production pipeline. Without doing this well, you risk spending just as much energy as you would creating a series of hand-made levels. Max Bottega (Creative Director / Co-Founder) is a veteran of art direction and asset production, with 20 years experience under his belt and being lead on titles like Cyberpunk2077, Assetto Corsa and many more. In this talk he’ll demonstrate his tips and tricks to create rich interesting environments in a scalable way. This will be practical and hands-on using assets, environments and building blocks used in Mac n Cheese Game's upcoming roguelite. You’ll come away with immediate techniques and ideas you can use yourself, take back to your team or just a better understanding how game developers create the procedural worlds you love. Note that although the talk will be using Unity, many of the techniques are generalizable to other engines.	max-bottega
practical-generation	2	full	10:45	19:45	Practical procedural world and story generation in Sea Of Rifts, a naval roguelike RPG	Learn how to use ProcGen techniques in a commercial game context, where how long it takes to write your generator, and how easy it is for non-technical persons on the team to integrate content into it, matters as much as the quality of the output. Alexander will give you advice on how to structure your generation so it is easy to expand, and how to create a good test workflow so the whole team can test their content. He will also show how iterating on the level generation led to use signed distance fields for island generation to fit with the requirements for the gameplay. The talk will end with a showcase of the custom tools and workflows he has created for his team to put art and story content into the game's generation.	alexander-birke
real-world	1	lightning	10:45	19:45	Bringing Real-World Occultism into Your Games Without Accidentally Being Racist	Do you want to make your fantasy roguelike stand out from all the other fantasy roguelikes? Do you want to bring REAL magic into your game? Do you want to scare the living daylights out of someone with some demonic sigils?  Did you know there's a million and one pitfalls about that spooky symbol you found online?  In this talk, learn about the most common forms of cultural appropriation in Western Esoterica, how to evaluate if something is suitable to use for aesthetic reasons, listen to some guy rant about people who have been dead for nearly a hundred years, and learn how to better bring occult practices and symbology into games you make. Together, we can Bring Real-World Occultism into our Games Without Accidentally Being Racist.	stanley-baxton

neutrino-watch	1	full	11:30	20:30	"Neutrinowatch - the podcast that plays itself "	Neutrinowatch is a podcast where every episode changes every day. Python code in the background overwrites the audio based on procedural generation and real world events and conditions to create a new version of each episode. Examples include:  - An astronomy show which uses the current positions of the stars visible from a different location - A song where the lyrics and instruments change  - An episode where two “robots” talk about real-world news headlines - A “Dear John” letter that gets rewritten every day - Monologues that fade in and out of focus  - Daily pieces of oblique advice for the creatively stuck  Every episode is alive, a new version appearing each day - which presents unique challenges and opportunities for making audio. In our talk, we’ll dive into a couple of episodes, sharing the techniques and lessons we’ve learned as we created the show - and the roles audio effects, ambience, music, and text-to-speech models have in the sound design. How can we make an episode that’s interesting to listen to once? Twice? Ten times? How often have we succeeded in making something replayable? Join us, and help us to answer these questions, and more…	jeff-emtman, martin-austwick

bradied-narrative	1	full	12:00	21:00	Braided Narratives: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Linear Stories	Creating dynamic, interactive narratives is hard, in no small part because of the massive amount of authoring effort they can require. I explore both where this authoring burden comes from and look at an approach to narrative design which avoids the exponential explosion of writing: braided narratives. Rather than every storyline or quest being its own fractal tree, we can wrap linear plots around each other to achieve dynamism through pacing instead of choice. Join me in this twisty adventure!	nic-junius

rise-of-roguelite	preview	guest-panel	13:00	22:00	Presentation of the upcoming book 'The Rise of the Roguelite: Inside a Gaming Phenomenon'	This talk will be a promotional presentation of the upcoming academic book ‘The Rise of the Roguelite: Inside a Gaming Phenomenon’, forthcoming with Taylor and Francis/CRC Press. This will be an edited collection of scholarly essays which explore roguelite games from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including game design, narrative studies, philosophy, sociology, gender studies, and queer studies. The book should be out by Christmas this year, and I cannot think of a better place to promote it and generate productive discussion of it than Roguelike Celebration.   The talk will feature me, the editor, outlining the aims and content of the project, talking about how it all came together, and why we felt it was a necessary undertaking for game studies and why it should make a productive contribution. My part of the talk will hopefully be supplemented by a short collection of videos from the contributing authors giving brief explanations of their chapters.  The table of contents of the book, to give you some idea, is as follows:  1) The Rise of the Roguelite (James Cartlidge) 2) When Darwin Met Lovecraft: Generating Mystery and Discovery in The Curious Expedition (Mark Johnson) 3) What Makes a Good Roguelite? (Marc Dolgin) 4) Roguelites and the Problem of Ludonarrative Dissonance (Leonardo Codamo) 5) Players’ Will and Characters’ Deeds: Agency and Legacy (Robert Seddon) 6) The Chain of Power: Foucault’s Philosophy and Survivors-like Roguelites (James Cartlidge) 7) Mechanics of Neoliberalism and Social Media in Enter the Gungeon (Steven Harvie) 8) Edit Wands Always: Experimentation, Modding, and Metagaming in Noita (Andrew Bailey) 9) Simulation Gaps, Failures, and the Potential for Queer Game Design (Xavier Ho) 10) Roguelites, Romance, and the Power of Genre-Bending in Boyfriend Dungeon (Christine Tomlinson) 11) Hades, the Queerness of Roguelites, and the Recursivity of Trauma (Katerina von Campe)  I have no doubt that the audience of Roguelike Celebration will be receptive to these topics, and scholarly work that can be done about these types of games. Thank you very much for considering this proposal, and if you have any further questions about it, please feel free to get in touch.	james-cartlidge
out-of-book	1	lightning	13:30	22:30	'Out of Book': The Psychology of Why Roguelikes Keep Us Playing	Why do humans love roguelikes? What's the difference between games that last for 5 hours or 500 hours, or even a lifetime? As a former Lead Game Systems Designer at Warner Bros, it was my job to create worlds that answered these questions. The secrets arise from patterns that come pre-installed in our brains that make us excited, build anticipation, and create joy from the pursuit of a goal.  In this talk, I'll dive into common behaviorist patterns in roguelikes and why people love them. We'll explore ancient games like Chess and Go, and modern titles like Oregon Trail, Slay the Spire, and Hades. I’ll discuss how dopamine truly works to create feelings of motivation and the psychological impact of randomness and procedural generation. We’ll also talk about the emotional impact of permadeath, how repeated failures lead to skill development and mastery, and what makes roguelikes infinitely replayable.	pandamander
use-of-knowledge	2	lightning	13:30	22:30	The Use of Knowledge in the Labyrinth: The price mechanism as a storytelling device	By featuring markets with prices that fluctuate in response to changing conditions, games can succinctly express information about the state of the game-world — the relative scarcity of resources, the concerns & appetites of NPCs, even the repercussions of the player's own actions — all without saying a word. In this talk, I will explore the use of prices for storytelling and look at some of the ways roguelikes and other games could (and do) make use of this device, as well as some reasons why scenario-sensitive prices may not be appropriate for certain games.	robin-mendoza

There are typically many methods we could use to generate stuff for our Roguelikes, and many ways we can tweak the parameters of a chosen system. But when these systems can produce huge numbers of unique artefacts, working out what which one producing the best stuff for our game is very challenging. Luckily this has also been an important issue for academic researchers looking at PCG, and one there have been significant advances in over the past two decades. In this talk I'll be giving a practical overview of techniques that you can use to assess your generator, based on the work of myself and my peers from the world of PCG research. "	ollie-withington

probably-impossible	1	full	14:15	23:15	Probably Impossible: NecroDancer's network code	"A technical overview of Crypt of the NecroDancer's unique approach to online multiplayer, based on the principles of rollback, while replacing the conventional frame-based timeline by a turn-based system. Bringing online multiplayer to a rhythm game in which players can directly interact with the world and each other poses many challenges that aren't typically encountered while working on other network games - all while preserving the emergent, quirky mechanics that the game's community grew to love.  This talk introduces a conventional rollback approach, then gradually shapes it into the architecture found in NecroDancer today, describing and resolving edge cases along the way. Follow the journey of how online multiplayer, a feature once dismissed as ""impossible"", was implemented!"	adrian-zeyfang
black-box	2	full	14:15	23:15	Black Box Sim for Roguelikes	"Gameplay architecture is vital to the success of a roguelike, but it doesn't get the attention it deserves. In this session, we'll cover the ""Black Box"" approach to running game simulations independently from input, UI, graphics, animation, VFX, and sound.  We'll start with an overview of the benefits of rigorously separating your game logic from input and presentation. Then, we’ll dive deep into a specific implementation that has been successfully used in multiple games, both launched and in the works. We'll break down how it's been used to implement replay systems, undo systems, damage preview, save/load, and networking.  By the end, you’ll see just how powerful this approach can be for your own games."	brian-cronin

new-levels	2	full	16:00	1:00	New Levels from a Single Example via Tree-based Reconstructive Partitioning (TRP)	"This talk is on Tree-based Reconstructive Partitioning (TRP), a level generation approach which can generate a suite of diverse, structurally sound levels based on a single example level. On a high level, TRP leverages a general game playing agent (Monte Carlo Tree Search) to create a representation of a level in terms of playable and unplayable areas, then recombines playable and unplayable areas from the input level to make new ones. TRP outperforms popular approaches like WaveFunctionCollapse in terms of plagiarism and playability.  In this talk, I’ll showcase the TRP approach. I’ll delve into how the algorithm itself works, show several examples across multiple game domains, and provide comparisons against several other popular low-data level generation approaches. The talk will end with a description of how to implement TRP via an example Godot implementation, along with exploring the challenges and issues with the algorithm and the future work that aims to address these concerns.  I’m particularly excited about this approach because of both the coherency of the output levels in comparison to other low data level generation approaches and the overall elegance of the algorithm. I hope to see you there! "	emily-halina

cheating-the-system	2	lightning	16:30	1:30	Cheating the System (By Design!) for Epic Combos	"Some games are designed with player-directed ""cheating"" in mind, where you build up a character with broken-seeming combos that make you feel like you're exploiting the game by growing your power exponentially. The Roguelike genre, in particular, has many examples of this phenomenon, benefitting from its coolness while having the built-in counterbalance of a frequent progress reset. In this talk, I'll discuss some of the reasons why these kinds of power escalations feel so good, approaches to balancing them, how they might apply to various genres, and how to design and implement them in a way that tips the scales into ""cheating"" rather than just ""here's a stronger weapon"". Done right, players will feel like they've done something even the game's developer didn't anticipate!"	courtney-liessen
doors	1	lightning	16:45	1:45	Doors or no Doors: How Roguelike games take you places	Having trouble getting people from one place to another? This is a small study of categorizing and identifying the ways of moving players in a constantly shifting game. We will explore a few genre of map systems and highlight why these were chosen, and I’ll share a few insights I’ve had in the last couple years of working on generative maps. The goal is to help game designers make decisions regarding how to improve map systems in roguelikes, and maybe even inspire a couple new takes on the current standard. Overall, I hope this talk is inspiring for viscerally immersive game design.	john-bond

It turns out, a lot of times, that it is the same properties that make procedural generation fun: a balance of chaos and order, complex behaviors from simple rules, and unexpected emergent behavior.  Allow me to present a gallery of my favorite mathematical visualizations, from classic mainstays like Ulam spirals to my own work on colorful Fibonacci quilts, and analyze them to get to the heart what truly makes procedurality amazing.	nat-alison
