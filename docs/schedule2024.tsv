rise-of-roguelite	preview	guest-panel	13:00	22:00	Presentation of the upcoming book 'The Rise of the Roguelite: Inside a Gaming Phenomenon'	This talk will be a promotional presentation of the upcoming academic book ‘The Rise of the Roguelite: Inside a Gaming Phenomenon’, forthcoming with Taylor and Francis/CRC Press. This will be an edited collection of scholarly essays which explore roguelite games from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including game design, narrative studies, philosophy, sociology, gender studies, and queer studies. The book should be out by Christmas this year, and I cannot think of a better place to promote it and generate productive discussion of it than Roguelike Celebration.   The talk will feature me, the editor, outlining the aims and content of the project, talking about how it all came together, and why we felt it was a necessary undertaking for game studies and why it should make a productive contribution. My part of the talk will hopefully be supplemented by a short collection of videos from the contributing authors giving brief explanations of their chapters.  The table of contents of the book, to give you some idea, is as follows:  1) The Rise of the Roguelite (James Cartlidge) 2) When Darwin Met Lovecraft: Generating Mystery and Discovery in The Curious Expedition (Mark Johnson) 3) What Makes a Good Roguelite? (Marc Dolgin) 4) Roguelites and the Problem of Ludonarrative Dissonance (Leonardo Codamo) 5) Players’ Will and Characters’ Deeds: Agency and Legacy (Robert Seddon) 6) The Chain of Power: Foucault’s Philosophy and Survivors-like Roguelites (James Cartlidge) 7) Mechanics of Neoliberalism and Social Media in Enter the Gungeon (Steven Harvie) 8) Edit Wands Always: Experimentation, Modding, and Metagaming in Noita (Andrew Bailey) 9) Simulation Gaps, Failures, and the Potential for Queer Game Design (Xavier Ho) 10) Roguelites, Romance, and the Power of Genre-Bending in Boyfriend Dungeon (Christine Tomlinson) 11) Hades, the Queerness of Roguelites, and the Recursivity of Trauma (Katerina von Campe)  I have no doubt that the audience of Roguelike Celebration will be receptive to these topics, and scholarly work that can be done about these types of games. Thank you very much for considering this proposal, and if you have any further questions about it, please feel free to get in touch.	james-cartlidge
literary-origins	preview	preview_talk	13:45	22:45	Literary Origins of the Rogue Archetype	Em and I were discussing the literary origins of the rogue archetype. It's reasonably well documented that the chain back from Rogue (1980) goes something like:  Rogue-->Original Dungeons & Dragons-->Fritz Leiber's Fahfrd and the Grey Mouser stories (cited in OD&D)/The Hobbit/Conan (specifically "Tower of the Elephant) (the three are roughly contemporaneous, and without research I can't tell exactly which one the genealogy runs through)-->Lord Dunsany's thief stories-->Hornung's Raffles stories-->Holmes (Doyle and Hornung were in-laws)-->Poe's Dupin stories-->???  As part of tracing this line of descent, I'd attempt to define precisely what we mean by the fantasy rogue, and then link it briefly to historical attempts to define roguelikes. Two paths that seem fruitful to investigate are:  * The notion that the fantasy rogue is defined by the architecturality of their activities (the notion of entering a specific https://sf-encyclopedia.com/fe/edifice to perpetrate theit activities), a characteristic that clearly separates them from the older and more general tradition of trickster archetypes. * The linkage of the architecturality of the fantasy rogue to the "labyrinth" in "procedural death labyrinths"  Other possible lines of inquiry include:  * Whether the notion of a particular "job" rather than general opportunistic theft helps define the fantasy rogue, making the jewel in "Tower of the Elephant" a predecessor of the Amulet of Yendor and the "Asphalt Jungle"/"Rififi"-codified heist genre a sibling of the roguelike. * Patterns in the linear-media tropes that survived adaptation to roguelikes vs. ones that didn't * The development of the rogue/gentleman-thief archetype as, like the development of the detective literary archetype, a social reaction to urbanization and anxieties about a move from a society based on tight-knit local communities to a society based on socially-atomized, market-and-law-mediated relationships (which, linking to the previous point, prioritize "jobs" over purely self-directed activity)	adnrew-cedotal

probably-impossible	1	full	TBA		Probably Impossible: NecroDancer's network code	A technical overview of Crypt of the NecroDancer's unique approach to online multiplayer, based on the principles of rollback, while replacing the conventional frame-based timeline by a turn-based system. Bringing online multiplayer to a rhythm game in which players can directly interact with the world and each other poses many challenges that aren't typically encountered while working on other network games - all while preserving the emergent, quirky mechanics that the game's community grew to love.  This talk introduces a conventional rollback approach, then gradually shapes it into the architecture found in NecroDancer today, describing and resolving edge cases along the way. Follow the journey of how online multiplayer, a feature once dismissed as "impossible", was implemented!	adrian-zeyfang
black-box	1	full	TBA		Black Box Sim for Roguelikes	Gameplay architecture is vital to the success of a roguelike, but it doesn't get the attention it deserves. In this session, we'll cover the "Black Box" approach to running game simulations independently from input, UI, graphics, animation, VFX, and sound.  We'll start with an overview of the benefits of rigorously separating your game logic from input and presentation. Then, we’ll dive deep into a specific implementation that has been successfully used in multiple games, both launched and in the works. We'll break down how it's been used to implement replay systems, undo systems, damage preview, save/load, and networking.  By the end, you’ll see just how powerful this approach can be for your own games.	brian-cronin
doors	1	lightning	TBA		Doors or no Doors: How Roguelike games take you places	In a fantasy setting, we accept dragons without explanation, even though they make no sense according to the laws of physics or biology. It is also so with dungeons, so pervasive in roguelike games as to be axiomatic. Massive, livable dungeons do not exist in real life, except they do in this one spot in Central Turkey called Cappadocia, which I just so happened to visit in May 2024. Is this talk a thinly-veiled attempt at sharing a travel slide show? Maybe, but I did take an incredible amount of photos, LIDAR video and assembled significant historical notes from a variety of sources.  There are many cave cities in Cappadocia, which could hold thousands of people each. This came to be here due to particular geological and social factors. The cave cities were known to be built and maintained over thousands of years, only falling into obscurity due to another weird geopolitical move called the 1923 Population Exchange between Greece and Turkey. The narrative I want to walk the audience through here is how all these random forces seemed to conspire to create these otherwise improbable underground cities.  I am going to share several interesting architectural features of these dungeons, all in the frame of how it could inspire gameplay, including: extruded steps, dovecuts, warning tubes, rolling doors, movable ladders.  Finding information about these cave cities is interesting as well: in the first wave of the internet, lots of mom and pop websites were made. However, these are mostly 404d now, incompletely replaced with Facebook groups. Finding maps of dungeons would require me to use the internet archive to get a pdf made by a German which I would then have to Google translate. This is made harder by the fact that Greece and Turkey consider each other cultural adversaries, and since the cave cities were made by the expelled Greeks, the Turkish government isn’t particularly excited about documenting them. Thus, finding information is a quest in itself.  Overall, I hope this talk is inspiring for viscerally immersive game design.	john-bond
cheating-the-system	1	lightning	TBA		Cheating the System (By Design!) for Epic Combos	Some games are designed with player-directed "cheating" in mind, where you build up a character with broken-seeming combos that make you feel like you're exploiting the game by growing your power exponentially. The Roguelike genre, in particular, has many examples of this phenomenon, benefitting from its coolness while having the built-in counterbalance of a frequent progress reset. In this talk, I'll discuss some of the reasons why these kinds of power escalations feel so good, approaches to balancing them, how they might apply to various genres, and how to design and implement them in a way that tips the scales into "cheating" rather than just "here's a stronger weapon". Done right, players will feel like they've done something even the game's developer didn't anticipate!	courtney-liessen
trampling-on-ghosts	1	full	TBA		Trampling on Ghosts: Hauntology and Permadeath	This talk is an attempt to challenge the ways in which roguelikes handle death, reincarnation, and the way in which the player's failures "haunt" the game's environments. We'll be looking at this through the lens of "hauntology", a cultural theory that deals in cycles of nostalgia and the ghosts that it creates, and looking at how this might apply to roguelites such as Inscryption and Returnal. I promise it won't be quite as morbid as it sounds.	harry-solomons
swarm-of-monsters	1	full	TBA		A Swarm of Monsters is Hard To Build: Generating Visual Concepts for Enemies in Roguelikes	Join Art Director Marlowe Dobbe for a deep dive into techniques she has used to generate visual concepts for enemies for roguelike games. Visual variety is an important consideration when working on games that are highly replayable, and these techniques can streamline the brainstorming process to help you to create a lot of unique and distinct enemy designs without letting the well run dry. Learn how to collect reference, generate ideas, and design an enemy alongside Marlowe during the presentation!	marlowe-dobbe
out-of-book	1	lightning	TBA		"Out of Book": The Psychology of Why Roguelikes Keep Us Playing	Why do humans love roguelikes? What's the difference between games that last for 5 hours or 500 hours, or even a lifetime? As a former Lead Game Systems Designer at Warner Bros, it was my job to create worlds that answered these questions. The secrets arise from patterns that come pre-installed in our brains that make us excited, build anticipation, and create joy from the pursuit of a goal.  In this talk, I'll dive into common behaviorist patterns in roguelikes and why people love them. We'll explore ancient games like Chess and Go, and modern titles like Oregon Trail, Slay the Spire, and Hades. I’ll discuss how dopamine truly works to create feelings of motivation and the psychological impact of randomness and procedural generation. We’ll also talk about the emotional impact of permadeath, how repeated failures lead to skill development and mastery, and what makes roguelikes infinitely replayable.	pandamander
neutrino-watch	1	full	TBA		Neutrinowatch - the podcast that plays itself 	Neutrinowatch is a podcast where every episode changes every day. Python code in the background overwrites the audio based on procedural generation and real world events and conditions to create a new version of each episode. Examples include:  - An astronomy show which uses the current positions of the stars visible from a different location - A song where the lyrics and instruments change  - An episode where two “robots” talk about real-world news headlines - A “Dear John” letter that gets rewritten every day - Monologues that fade in and out of focus  - Daily pieces of oblique advice for the creatively stuck  Every episode is alive, a new version appearing each day - which presents unique challenges and opportunities for making audio. In our talk, we’ll dive into a couple of episodes, sharing the techniques and lessons we’ve learned as we created the show - and the roles audio effects, ambience, music, and text-to-speech models have in the sound design. How can we make an episode that’s interesting to listen to once? Twice? Ten times? How often have we succeeded in making something replayable? Join us, and help us to answer these questions, and more…	jeff-emtman, martin-austwick
chase-basic	1	full	TBA		Chase: The BASIC Language Proto-Roguelike	In the early years of computing, a small turn-based game called Chase, built in the BASIC programming language, had players escaping robots and luring them into obstacles. It soon developed variations and enhancements as it spread to other computer systems. On the 60th anniversary of BASIC, we will examine these "robotlike" games and how the gameplay might be used in modern roguelikes.	dan-norder
bradied-narrative	1	full	TBA		Braided Narratives: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Linear Stories	Creating dynamic, interactive narratives is hard, in no small part because of the massive amount of authoring effort they can require. I explore both where this authoring burden comes from and look at an approach to narrative design which avoids the exponential explosion of writing: braided narratives. Rather than every storyline or quest being its own fractal tree, we can wrap linear plots around each other to achieve dynamism through pacing instead of choice. Join me in this twisty adventure!	nic-junius
keeping-art	1	lightning	TBA		Keeping Art Direction interesting in a procedurally generated world		max-bottega
enhancing-narrative	1	full	TBA		Enhancing Narrative Through Randomness and Complications	Discover how randomness, particularly through oracles and partial successes, can transform game narratives from predictable paths into dynamic, unique stories. This talk will explore how random elements can drive compelling plotlines without relying on predefined lore, and how diverse complications can turn failures into opportunities for narrative branching. Through practical examples and case studies, we'll explore how structured randomness can lead to emergent storytelling that surprises both players and creators alike.	cezar-capacle
finding-your-80	1	full	TBA		Finding your 80/20 Rule with Proc-Gen	The 80-20 rule means different things to different people, so let's talk about all of them! (not really) What we are going to chat about is how the "80/20 rule" applies to production time, design familiarity, and player expectations in procedural generation.  Real takeaways in include: "how polished is polished enough" for generative systems, "how granular should this system be", and "how much does the player think is actually generating versus static", "what does the community share in its experience" and what games have excelled at these properties in gaming. 	tyler-coleman
magic-in-design	1	lightning	TBA		Magic in Game Design: (Mis)Directing the Player's Attention	In addition to the jobs listed above, I've also worked as a theatrical special effects designer and operator. Some of the lessons there carry over to designing Roguelikes. My game series GearHead is known for its procedural narration; I use techniques from stage magic and fortune telling to make the player believe the story. As a gamedev you are also a performer. This talk will focus on tricks game devs can learn from magic to draw the player into your game. Not literally; that'd be witchcraft instead.	joe-hewitt
right-variety	1	lightning	TBA		The Right Variety: Understanding and Visualising the Output Diversity of Your Generators	Selecting and tuning generators for games is hard! There are typically many methods we could use to generate stuff for our Roguelikes, and many ways we can tweak the parameters of a chosen system. But when these systems can produce huge numbers of unique artefacts, working out what which one producing the best stuff for our game is very challenging. Luckily this has also been an important issue for academic researchers looking at PCG, and one there have been significant advances in over the past two decades. In this talk I'll be giving a practical overview of techniques that you can use to assess your generator, based on the work of myself and my peers from the world of PCG research. 	ollie-withington
use-of-knowledge	1	lightning	TBA		The Use of Knowledge in the Labyrinth: The price mechanism as a storytelling device	By featuring markets with prices that fluctuate in response to changing conditions, games can succinctly express information about the state of the game-world — the relative scarcity of resources, the concerns & appetites of NPCs, even the repercussions of the player's own actions — all without saying a word. In this talk, I will explore the use of prices for storytelling and look at some of the ways roguelikes and other games could (and do) make use of this device, as well as some reasons why scenario-sensitive prices may not be appropriate for certain games.	robin-mendoza
big-wishes	1	lightning	TBA		100'000 wishlists in 3 months - Weird roguelikes are taking over the world	The roguelike genre continues to ride a massive wave of popularity. New games are added to a long list of releases on a daily basis, leaving the market fairly crowded. However, as the genre matures, more and more sub-genres are emerging. Inspired by the success of Peglin, our studio decided to take a swing at putting together a demo for a 'physics rougelike', combining classic mechanics of the genre with the arcady physics of a claw machine. We named the 'Dungeon Clawler' and it has managed to earn 100k+ wishlists in its first 3 months on Steam. This talk goes into detail on how the game was designed and marketed.	philomena-schwab
practical-generation	1	full	TBA		Practical procedural world and story generation in Sea Of Rifts, a naval roguelike RPG	Learn how to use ProcGen techniques in a commercial game context, where how long it takes to write your generator, and how easy it is for non-technical persons on the team to integrate content into it, matters as much as the quality of the output. Alexander will give you advice on how to structure your generation so it is easy to expand, and how to create a good test workflow so the whole team can test their content. He will also show how iterating on the level generation led to use signed distance fields for island generation to fit with the requirements for the gameplay. The talk will end with a showcase of the custom tools and workflows he has created for his team to put art and story content into the game's generation.	alexander-birke
orb-pondering	1	full	TBA		Orb Pondering Simulator LIVE!	Orb Pondering Simulator LIVE! is an audiovisual meditation opportunity and/or game about boredom played by a live online audience. Breathe in sync with a glowing, pulsating orb for increasingly extended periods of time! Interact with the synesthetic music system using chat commands! Gamify enlightenment!	isaac-io-schankler
new-levels	1	full	TBA		New Levels from a Single Example via Tree-based Reconstructive Partitioning (TRP)	This talk is on Tree-based Reconstructive Partitioning (TRP), a level generation approach which can generate a suite of diverse, structurally sound levels based on a single example level. On a high level, TRP leverages a general game playing agent (Monte Carlo Tree Search) to create a representation of a level in terms of playable and unplayable areas, then recombines playable and unplayable areas from the input level to make new ones. TRP outperforms popular approaches like WaveFunctionCollapse in terms of plagiarism and playability.  In this talk, I’ll showcase the TRP approach. I’ll delve into how the algorithm itself works, show several examples across multiple game domains, and provide comparisons against several other popular low-data level generation approaches. The talk will end with a description of how to implement TRP via an example Godot implementation, along with exploring the challenges and issues with the algorithm and the future work that aims to address these concerns.  I’m particularly excited about this approach because of both the coherency of the output levels in comparison to other low data level generation approaches and the overall elegance of the algorithm. I hope to see you there! 	emily-halina
real-world	1	lightning	TBA		Bringing Real-World Occultism into Your Games Without Accidentally Being Racist	Do you want to make your fantasy roguelike stand out from all the other fantasy roguelikes? Do you want to bring REAL magic into your game? Do you want to scare the living daylights out of someone with some demonic sigils?  Did you know there's a million and one pitfalls about that spooky symbol you found online?  In this talk, learn about the most common forms of cultural appropriation in Western Esoterica, how to evaluate if something is suitable to use for aesthetic reasons, listen to some guy rant about people who have been dead for nearly a hundred years, and learn how to better bring occult practices and symbology into games you make. Together, we can Bring Real-World Occultism into our Games Without Accidentally Being Racist.	stanley-baxton
permacomputing	1	lightning	TBA		Uxn: Permacomputing & Roguelikes	Will your favorite roguelikes still be playable in 20 years? How about 50? The Uxn/Varvara ecosystem is a radically simple, portable, and personal approach to computing. Learn how to produce games that fit in 64-kilobyte ROMs and which run on 25-year-old hardware as easily as on modern computers or web browsers. Embrace limits to fuel your creativity!	eirkr-osheim
going-legit	1	full	TBA		Going legit with DotA: How to transform a thousand authors into four	In 2015 Lilith games contests a complaint for copyright infringement sent to them by Valve. The dispute is over Defense of the Ancients (DotA) the multi million dollar E-sports and casual play intellectual property. This contesting escalates into a multi year lawsuit in which Lilith games challenges Valve and Blizzards claim to DotA, trying to claim it as a ’collective work’, pressuring these mega companies to frantically try and establish a ’'legitimate'' claim to their intellectual property. And in the process transforming the games formerly thousands of authors into four.   All this of course being in opposition to DotA’s nature – as a collective work.  Lets dive into how Valve successfully transformed the narrative of DotA’s development to the detriment of 99% of it’s authors and community and how we can prepare ourselves for ownership heists like these.  I suggest starting by looking to the practices of many a roguelike developer.	kaysa-konopljak
