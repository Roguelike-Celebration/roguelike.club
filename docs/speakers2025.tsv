We typically design procedural generators with aspirations of unique, emergent outcomes, but perhaps there's a value to the sludge. I explore the development of my receipt printer artwork 'Kiss Garden', and how it generates an endless narrative of failing relationships while maintaining a forward momentum.

But there's actually a underexplored design space in deckbuilding games that has the player adding (or removing) cards in groups or sets. The set-based approach has very different affordances, and might actually be a better fit for certain kinds of roguelike deckbuilders. This talk is a quick look at this mechanical space, showing some of the games that have used it, and taking a critical look from a design perspective.	Alexander King is a game designer, analyst and teaching artist based in Brooklyn New York. His work centers on data-driven design and simulation, and his work has been featured in festivals like ALT.CTRL.GDC and IndieCade. He is the economy designer for Dear Reader, a puzzle game about public domain literature that is frequently listed as one of the best games in Apple's subscription service Apple Arcade. Alexander is also an adjunct professor at the NYU Game Center and Parsons Design & Technology program, where he teaches classes on games and systems design, and spreadsheets. He is the staff data analyst (and proud member) of ACT-UAW Local 7902, which represents part-time faculty at NYU and the New School. Before working in games, Alexander was an analytics consultant working in finance and ecommerce, but the economies he models now are usually fictional.	dont-pick-just-one

Art direction and tech art in Sea Of Rifts, a naval story generation RPG	Art direction and production for procedural games is tricky. Artists need to understand the technical limitations and opportunities the medium offers, while programmers must create artist friendly workflows that also support the chosen aesthetic, and still have enough time to code the game itself. Last year Alex gave a talk on the procedural world, story, and character generation in Sea Of Rifts. We now want to open the lid on the treasure trove of experience we have gained on how to efficiently create art content for a generated 3D game in terms of direction, workflow, and technical solutions. In the talk we will first cover the overall art goals of the game. Sofie will then cover the specific techniques and design rules used to design the visuals, how we give feedback to each other, and why artists knowing the basics of the technical implementation, is a big win for the whole team. Alex will round off the talk with showing various artist friendly workflows and clever shader and GPU tricks we use to create a lot of visual variation in the game.

Even better, did that feeling linger as you tested new hypotheses and re-evaluated your understanding of how the game worked and what was possible within it? If those experiences stick with you, then you'll be in good company as Alexei Pepers shares the work of likeminded designers to define this feeling we call 'system suspense'. She'll share how we can apply the concepts of suspense and surprise to the way that players build mental models of game systems, and then dig into examples of successful techniques for evoking system suspense in games such as Caves of Qud, Blaseball, and Baldur's Gate 3. <br /><br />This talk was originally given at GDC 2025, where the recording will be behind a hefty paywall for two years. For the Roguelike Celebration preview event, Alexei is going open source and adapting her talk to share freely!	Alexei is a technical systems designer with a focus on procedural generation. A founding member of Inflexion Games, she previously built the systems underpinning the procedural realms of Nightingale, and in particular developed the realm card system that gives players an in-game method of influencing generative parameters. Her interest in blending player agency with procedural systems led her next to Blaseball and then Gardens, as she continues to explore frameworks that make the most of combining developer creativity with systemic variety. But her proudest contribution to game development has been her contributions to Roguelike Celebration, as a speaker starting in 2016, and organizer from 2020 onward!	system-suspense

When a player chooses between 3 cards, what is going through their head? This talk is about how to achieve deep but accessible drafting decisions which result in memorable games that excite players. Synergy Networks are a helpful lens for creating sets of cards that achieve these aims. Modeling the synergies between cards as a network allows us to use ideas from network theory like path length, density and hubs. Digressions will include characteristics of synergies, broad types of synergies useful for brainstorming, and why anti-synergy is just as important as synergy itself. This talk is informed by my work designing Hellscaper and Mr Magpie's Harmless Card Game, two roguelike deckbuilders.	I'm a game designer / programmer whose creative interests include horror games, journaling games and roguelike deckbuilders. I love the feeling of improvising on the spot while you're drafting.

jeff-lait	Jeff Lait		placeholder.png	Teaching Long Term Consequences in Games	Games excel at the short-term feedback loop. These are often intentionally designed into larger and larger structures to make video games both accessible and fun. Unfortunately, this is not a realistic expectation for how the actual world works, where the immediate reward loop may oppose the long term optimum. I have struggled with this concept since my earliest Seven Day Roguelikes. This talk will outline the lessons I have learned in the process, and hopefully game players think beyond the next dopamine hit, and encourage designers to challenge their players.	Jeff Lait is the developer of the roguelike POWDER, designed for the Gameboy Advance and ported to many systems since then.

seth-cooper	Seth Cooper	http://sethcooper.net/ 	seth-cooper.jpg	Building a Roguelike with a Tile Rewrite Language	"In this talk I'll discuss developing a simple Roguelike in a new tile rewrite-based programming language. Tile rewrites are a way to express changes in state by replacing one arrangement of tiles with another. For example, the player tile ""P"" moving right onto a blank tile ""_"" could be represented by replacing the tiles ""P _"" with ""_ P"". <br /><br />Based on the tile rewriting concept, myself and a team of collaborators are developing a new visual game programming language, along with a with an editor and game engine with debugging tools. In this system, the game state is the 2D game board, changes are rewrites of tile patterns, and conditional checks are based on matching tile patterns. Players make choices by selecting from available rewrites. General logic flow is handled by a behavior-tree like language of nodes that succeed or fail based on the result of the nodes they call. <br /><br />Using this system, we are working on a Roguelike with dungeon generation, exploration, treasure, enemies, and combat. We hope that the visual, direct nature of rewrite rules in the editor and engine could make them a fun and approachable way to develop small tile- and turn-based games."

stephen-ware	Stephen G. Ware	https://bsky.app/profile/sgware.bsky.social 	stephen-ware.png	Planning and Replanning Structured Adaptive Stories: 25 Years of History	Emergent stories are great for games like Dwarf Fortress, but sometimes interactive stories have a required ending or structure they have to follow. In these situations, you need to plan your story in advance to anticipate the consequences of a player's choice on what is possible. Most planned stories are designed by hand (think Choose Your Own Adventure books), but there has also been 25 years of research on story planning algorithms that can rewrite a structured story while a game is running. This talk will give a short history of the challenges of representing a story as a data structure suitable for algorithmic generation, including how we model events, intentions, beliefs, conflict, and emotion. This history will be told though a series of bad stories generated by earlier systems and how those mis-spun tales motivated next steps in the research.	Stephen G. Ware is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and runs the Narrative Intelligence Lab at the University of Kentucky where he teaches courses on game development and AI.

In this presentation I will introduce keepsake games and reflect on the potential for procedural systems to be designed to produce keepsakes through prompting cumulative creative acts by a player. In particular, the interplay between digital and analogue PCG and keepsakes will be explored through a series of case studies; the digital keepsake game ArchaeOS that I co-developed, a series of hybrid keepsake games produced during a workshop I ran at the Dagstuhl computer science seminar, and an academic study I conducted on player recordings. This talk will provide examples of how and why keepsake games provide memorable gameplay experiences, and will be applicable to both players and designers interested in the overlaps between TTRPG and digital game design.	I am a researcher and game designer who specialises in the contemporary archaeology of video games. I design larps, TTRPGs and digital games with a particular focus on playful approaches to recording gameplay experiences.	keepsake
