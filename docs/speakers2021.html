                  Roguelikes are well-known for their ability to generate infinitely complex histories, but how do you make such a detailed—and often ephemeral—historical record an accessible resource for storytelling? We discuss our experience as fan-archivists and tool-builders for the absurdist online baseball simulator, Blaseball, and how going beyond  the raw event log to increase data accessibility, automate insights, and encourage “creative” statistical interpretations helps make storytellers out of everyone in the community by sharing not just data, but meaning.

There are a lot of fantastic ideas and implementations in that world that are worth seeing - as a developer and as a player. I'd like to talk about some of the ones I've got the inspiration to create Chronicles of Stampadia (https://kesiev.com/stampadia), a print-and-play roguelike. And maybe suggest some other interesting board games with randomized exploration.</div>

One day, I tripped to another world, where there are no boundaries between games and toys, where everything is indie, where AAA games are roguelike. Sometimes I bring back some souvenir from that board game world: one of them is Chronicle of Stampadia - but there is a lot more out there.</div>

                <div class="talk-title">Cyclic Plot Generation in a Mixed-Initiative Narrative Instrument</div>
                <div class="talk-description">I am developing 'druid game', a narrative instrument which explores the 'clinamen' of plot between mages, priests, and cultists all fighting to control a dangerous and ultimately unknowable world, hurting each other badly in the process. Rather than taking the perspective of any one player in this game, I ask that the querent read through and with the narrative instrument, which proposes a dramatic plot and a sequence of scenes (one of many possible) through which it is articulated. I will argue that this approach maximizes the value of the system to creative player retellings while minimizing content burden on the narrative designer (also me for now).</div>
                <div class="bio">I create and study 'software instruments', including roguelikes and other interfaces to virtual life-worlds. My game design work is inspired by pen-and-paper storygames, and by my professional work with scientific models as an interactive visualization developer and mathematician. I am doing research toward a PhD in Computational Media at UC Santa Cruz.</div>

                <div class="talk-description">After Rogue became popular in the early days of the genre, a number of other games became popular in university computer rooms, games like Super Rogue, URogue and Advanced Rogue (sense a theme?) The talk would talk about and demonstrate these games live, thanks to the efforts of the Roguelike Preservation Society (which is itself now in need of preserving). Depending on time I might also demonstrate and talk about Larn, once a "major roguelike" that has fallen into obscurity these days, a game that takes a very different approach to roguelike concepts.</div>
                <div class="bio">John Harris wrote (and, once in a while, still writes) the column @Play on roguelikes, which sometimes people tell me opened their eyes to roguelikes. He also has written an ever-increasing number of books on various gaming topics, from roguelikes to romhacks. He made couple of issues of a fanzine called Extended Play. And once in a while he even makes games himself.</div>

                <div class="talk-title">Video Game Quest Theory for Improved Procedural Content Generation</div>
                <div class="talk-description"><p>I will present my work on general video game quest theory. Specifically, I want to have an in depth discussion of my proposed definition of a quest, as well as a new paradigm for classifying quests which can replace the old side/main quest model.</p>

                 <p>I believe this is relevant to the rogue-like community and in particular those who are interested in procedural quest generation because my quest definition is the first technical definition of a quest in academic literature. A technical definition like mine better supports technical applications of quests, and adoption of the definition in the PCG community could foster better collaboration within the community. The new paradigm that I would like to introduce allows for more flexibility in characterizing the constraints of the quest and purpose of the quest within the design space. I believe those interested in procedural quest generation can leverage this paradigm to better specify the kinds of generation they are aiming for. This is useful because it can help set the expectations of the system more appropriately, rather than a system producing main or side quests that do not fully meet the expectations of the user due to the baggage that the main/side quest terminology carries. </p>
                  
                  <p>Additionally, this work is already being used in my company at improbable to better design quests and understand the design space we are working in, and has already proved useful in 
                  the practical development of our game. </p>

                <div class="talk-description"><p>i will discuss several typical Rogue spell/combat effects like bump-to-attack, Teleport, Polymorph, Poison. sketch out some of the possibility space that different games can explore from these basic ideas, and the considerations of how they interact with other design elements, drawing some examples from my own games.</p>

                <p>e.g. consider 868-HACK's .POLY: a very cheap polymorph spell that affects all enemies on the level. this would be a huge and overly unpredictable effect if there was wide variance in enemy strength, but with only 4 enemy types of roughly equal power it's legit.</p>
                  
                <p>the goal is to inspire people to stretch genre tropes in a unique way to fit their own game. to see tropes as a flexible empowering toolbox and not a constraint.</p></div>

                  <p>Parents have run up against a host of software largely made for an older player base.</p>
                  
                  <p>This talk presents a few parenting-simulations you can conduct while playing your game to judge its suitability for parents. A few examples of failures and low-cost fixes are shown. </p>

                <div class="talk-description"><p>Fireballs.  Super attacks. Fatalities.  Summons.  Limit breaks.</p>

                  <p>Whatever you want to call them, some videogame attacks are more complex than a simple punch or kick.  And some games have ridiculous amounts of super attacks, each carefully choreographed, using sounds, music, particles, animations, and anything else the game engine can possibly display.  We know that all this content was created by loads of hard-working developers working insane hours.</p>
                  
                  <p>So can't we procedurally generate them?</p></div>

                  In 2010, his muse called him to make a multiplayer coop spaceship game, called "Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator".  It was instantly popular, and gained a loyal and responsive fanbase.  Thom has continued to update and extend Artemis, and is currently working on Artemis Cosmos, a complete ground-up re-write.</div>

                <div class="talk-description"><p>I'm making a game called Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator, about buying and selling the fleshy meat parts of sentient beings in a strange and evolving universe. This required making an intergalactic stock market. Which required defining the value of a given organ. Which required defining a list of organs. Which required defining what is and is not an organ in the first place, and so on, in an endless line.</p>

                 <p>The process broke our team. Not in terms of crunch, or mental health, but in the realization that so many of the systems and definitions used in every aspect of our reality are *invented*. False. Arbitrary decisions from someone else we'd never meet.</p>
                  
                  <p>In this lightning talk, we're going to show the necessary and powerful existential hell of unravelling your game's systems to discover the implicit ethical considerations beneath. A seemingly simple or absurdist game can reveal the arbitrary nonsensicality of the systems we live within every day--and cause one to demand better systems in the process.</p>
