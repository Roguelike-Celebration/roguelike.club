building-synergy-networks	preview	preview_talk	16:00	1:00	Building Synergy Networks for better Roguelike Deckbuilders	Roguelike Deckbuilders live or die on the quality of the drafting decisions they present. When a player chooses between 3 cards, what is going through their head? This talk is about how to achieve deep but accessible drafting decisions which result in memorable games that excite players. Synergy Networks are a helpful lens for creating sets of cards that achieve these aims. Modeling the synergies between cards as a network allows us to use ideas from network theory like path length, density and hubs. Digressions will include characteristics of synergies, broad types of synergies useful for brainstorming, and why anti-synergy is just as important as synergy itself. This talk is informed by my work designing Hellscaper and Mr Magpie's Harmless Card Game, two roguelike deckbuilders.	ezra-szanton
system-suspense	preview	preview_talk	16:30	1:30	Designing for System Suspense (Open Source Edition)	Have you ever been playing a game that took a sudden swerve so surprising that it left you thinking woah, what is this game even going to do next? Even better, did that feeling linger as you tested new hypotheses and re-evaluated your understanding of how the game worked and what was possible within it? If those experiences stick with you, then you'll be in good company as Alexei Pepers shares the work of likeminded designers to define this feeling we call 'system suspense'. She'll share how we can apply the concepts of suspense and surprise to the way that players build mental models of game systems, and then dig into examples of successful techniques for evoking system suspense in games such as Caves of Qud, Blaseball, and Baldur's Gate 3. <br /><br />This talk was originally given at GDC 2025, where the recording will be behind a hefty paywall for two years. For the Roguelike Celebration preview event, Alexei is going open source and adapting her talk to share freely!	alexei-pepers

roots	1	full	9:30	18:30	The Roots of Roguelikes in Fantasy Fiction	Let's take a journey into the past, before Rogue itself, back even before Dungeons and Dragons, into the tales of mystery and wonder that inspired these adventures. We'll delve into fragments of text from ancient scrolls and discuss how specific game mechanics derived from these sources.	michael-brough
hand-crafted-mix	1	full	10:00	19:00	Mixing hand-crafted content with procgen to achieve quality	As I was working on Dead Cells back in 2018 at Motion Twin, we constantly tried to strike a balance between randomly generated content and handcrafted design to suit our very small team of 5 people back then. Now I'm doing the same thing for Tenjutsu, my new upcoming rogue, but this time I'm making a full open city all by myself. I will explain how I approached that and why!	sebastien-bernard
stuff	1	lightning	10:30	19:30	Stuff: the behavioral science of inventory	The instinct to collect, arrange, display, and share is a core piece of what makes us human. Why do we do it? What makes an inventory stressful and annoying vs. a pleasurable exercise in agency and self-expression? And how does the threat of losing all that, of death, in a videogame (and outside it) shape those actions?  <br /> <br />Folks will learn: < br />- how different schools of scholarly thought think about the human relationship with objects <br />- -how screens change that (because how we perceive things on screens is fundamentally different from how we perceive meatspace data) <br />- Where the levers are to influence a player’s emotional relationship with in-game objects	max-sahin
keepsake	1	lightning	10:45	19:45	Roll for Reminiscence: Procedural Keepsake Games	The term keepsake game, coined by designer Shing Yin Khor, refers to games in which the gameplay process itself produces an artefact. In this presentation I will introduce keepsake games and reflect on the potential for procedural systems to be designed to produce keepsakes through prompting cumulative creative acts by a player. In particular, the interplay between digital and analogue PCG and keepsakes will be explored through a series of case studies; the digital keepsake game ArchaeOS that I co-developed, a series of hybrid keepsake games produced during a workshop I ran at the Dagstuhl computer science seminar, and an academic study I conducted on player recordings. This talk will provide examples of how and why keepsake games provide memorable gameplay experiences, and will be applicable to both players and designers interested in the overlaps between TTRPG and digital game design.	florence-smith-nicholls

hoist-the-colors	1	full	11:30	20:30	Hoist the colours! Art direction and tech art in Sea Of Rifts, a naval story generation RPG	Art direction and production for procedural games is tricky. Artists need to understand the technical limitations and opportunities the medium offers, while programmers must create artist friendly workflows that also support the chosen aesthetic, and still have enough time to code the game itself. Last year Alex gave a talk on the procedural world, story, and character generation in Sea Of Rifts. We now want to open the lid on the treasure trove of experience we have gained on how to efficiently create art content for a generated 3D game in terms of direction, workflow, and technical solutions. In the talk we will first cover the overall art goals of the game. Sofie will then cover the specific techniques and design rules used to design the visuals, how we give feedback to each other, and why artists knowing the basics of the technical implementation, is a big win for the whole team. Alex will round off the talk with showing various artist friendly workflows and clever shader and GPU tricks we use to create a lot of visual variation in the game.	alex-birke, sofie-schmidt

From stickers and paper lanterns to PCBs, furniture, and even physical procedural generators, this talk explores the challenges and creative possibilities of bringing generative projects into tangible form.	bleeptrack
non-euclidian	1	full	12:30	21:30	The best genre for a non-Euclidean game	The talk is about the use of non-Euclidean geometry in HyperRogue. I will explain what non-Euclidean geometry actually is with a short Rogue-themed explanation , and then explain how various parts of the roguelike philosophy synergize with the concept of a non-Euclidean game.	zeno-rogue

In this talk, Cole Wehrle talks about the creation of Oath how he adapted roguelike design conventions to the peculiar demands of a political strategy board game. 	cole-wehrle
long-term-consequences	1	full	14:00	23:00	Teaching Long Term Consequences in Games	Games excel at the short-term feedback loop. These are often intentionally designed into larger and larger structures to make video games both accessible and fun. Unfortunately, this is not a realistic expectation for how the actual world works, where the immediate reward loop may oppose the long term optimum. I have struggled with this concept since my earliest Seven Day Roguelikes. This talk will outline the lessons I have learned in the process, and hopefully game players think beyond the next dopamine hit, and encourage designers to challenge their players.	jeff-lait

mythopoetic-qud	1	lightning	15:00	0:00	A Mythopoetic Interface Reading of *Caves of Qud*	*Caves of Qud* renders a world where artifacts of the distant past present elaborate legends from the events of historic characters’ lives. In the same way, the game’s interface elaborates on the player character’s abstracted interactions and experiences to present their own legend. This talk proposes a reading of *Qud*’s interface as mythopoetic—representing the player’s story as mythologized and metaphorical rather than directly literal. This interpretation of *Caves of Qud*’s narrative and themes offers the play experience as one more myth-made layer to dig through.	ray
slay-the-sql	1	lightning	15:15	0:15	Wait, No, Hear Me Out: Simulating Encounter AI in Slay the Spire with SQL	Bring your best warding potions, safety sigils, and blessings: this talk is a light dip of some cursed queries to show how to simulate Slay the Spire's encounter AI with nothing more than SQL (and a lot of free time). Along the way, we'll go over some basic data structures for simulation, declarative vs imperative programming and how (with a little probability) even simple systems can lead to memorable, complex AI.	jonathan-pagnutti

adaptive-stories	1	full	16:30	1:30	Planning and Replanning Structured Adaptive Stories: 25 Years of History	Emergent stories are great for games like Dwarf Fortress, but sometimes interactive stories have a required ending or structure they have to follow. In these situations, you need to plan your story in advance to anticipate the consequences of a player’s choice on what is possible. Most planned stories are designed by hand (think Choose Your Own Adventure books), but there has also been 25 years of research on story planning algorithms that can rewrite a structured story while a game is running. This talk will give a short history of the challenges of representing a story as a data structure suitable for algorithmic generation, including how we model events, intentions, beliefs, conflict, and emotion. This history will be told though a series of bad stories generated by earlier systems and how those mis-spun tales motivated next steps in the research.	stephen-ware

dyke-sex	2	lightning	09:45	18:45	Dyke sex and ennui: Generating unending narrative in 'Kiss Garden'	What if it just never damn ends? We typically design procedural generators with aspirations of unique, emergent outcomes, but perhaps there's a value to the sludge. I explore the development of my receipt printer artwork 'Kiss Garden', and how it generates an endless narrative of failing relationships while maintaining a forward momentum.	ada-null
maxwells-demons	2	full	10:00	19:00	We Are Maxwell's Demons: The Thermodynamics of Procedural Generators	Younès will compare the work a PCG designer does to the tiny Demon in Maxwell's thought experiment. They will show how it's possible to make a mathematical analogy between the behaviour of procedural generators on our computers and how gas behaves in the real world. That bridge opens up fascinating possibilities, like classifying generators as being liquid, solid and gaseous, likening the design process of a generator to a thermodynamic cycle or even comparing the new wave of GenAI systems to internal combustion engines.	younes-rabii
reality-tv	2	lightning	10:30	19:30	The Procedurality of Reality TV Design - An Overview.	Earlier speakers have already established that Reality TV is a roguelike, now to the question of how to make your roguelike more like Reality TV. A few simple techniques combine to infinitely interesting emergent situations depending on the players input. But for Reality TV designers, that’s only half of the job, you also have to take those situations and turn into meaningful tv entertainment. Prepare to be challenged to add social and narrative systems design to your projects.	dennis-greger

wildermyth	2	full	13:45	22:45	Hand-Crafted Randomness: Storytelling in Wildermyth's Proc-Gen World	How do we make memorable characters and story moments when they're procedurally generated? How much hand-crafted content needs to be interwoven with procedural content to immerse the player in a story-driven world? (Spoiler: A lot!) Wildermyth is a party-based tactical storytelling RPG, and this talk will go over how we generate memorable characters and put those characters in situations that further characterize them.<br /><br /> We'll show the developer tools we created to help bring the story events and dialogue to life, specifically focusing on the ways hand-written dialogue works with the procedural heroes and events. We'll also go over how our combat maps similarly use a combination of hand-crafted and procedural content.	patrick-belanger, jackson-wagner
music-algorithm-showcase	2	full	14:15	23:15	Music algorithm showcase	I'm developing the game Rhythm Doggo. Though it's not a roguelike, its music is entirely algorithmic and composed in my own custom made music software. In this talk, I'd like to show off around 10 different algorithms, how they work and what they sound like, then end the talk with a little live performance of them all together.	nifflas

tile-rewrite	2	lightning	15:15	0:15	Building a Roguelike with a Tile Rewrite Language	"In this talk I'll discuss developing a simple Roguelike in a new tile rewrite-based programming language. Tile rewrites are a way to express changes in state by replacing one arrangement of tiles with another. For example, the player tile ""P"" moving right onto a blank tile ""_"" could be represented by replacing the tiles ""P _"" with ""_ P"". <br /><br />Based on the tile rewriting concept, myself and a team of collaborators are developing a new visual game programming language, along with a with an editor and game engine with debugging tools. In this system, the game state is the 2D game board, changes are rewrites of tile patterns, and conditional checks are based on matching tile patterns. Players make choices by selecting from available rewrites. General logic flow is handled by a behavior-tree like language of nodes that succeed or fail based on the result of the nodes they call. <br /><br />Using this system, we are working on a Roguelike with dungeon generation, exploration, treasure, enemies, and combat. We hope that the visual, direct nature of rewrite rules in the editor and engine could make them a fun and approachable way to develop small tile- and turn-based games."	seth-cooper
morgue	2	lightning	15:30	0:30	Anatomy of a Morgue File	Each game in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup ends with a morgue file: a detailed textual artifact of the game that you get to cherish forever.

dont-pick-just-one	2	lightning	15:45	0:45	Don’t Pick Just One: Set-Based Card Mechanics in Roguelike-Deckbuilders	Most deckbuilders (roguelike or otherwise) focus on the interesting choices around a adding single card at a time to your deck. But there's actually a underexplored design space in deckbuilding games that has the player adding (or removing) cards in groups or sets. The set-based approach has very different affordances, and might actually be a better fit for certain kinds of roguelike deckbuilders. This talk is a quick look at this mechanical space, showing some of the games that have used it, and taking a critical look from a design perspective.	alexander-king
playtesting-process	2	full	16:00	1:00	Playtesting Process for Ultra Small Teams	Making a roguelike with a tiny team (or just you)? You don’t need a giant QA department to get incredible feedback, just a smart, repeatable process. Over the past five years, I’ve refined a lightweight 1-on-1 playtesting approach that has powered every project I’ve worked on. I’ll show you how to find testers, run effective sessions, and turn raw reactions into actionable insights you can prioritize and act on. You’ll leave with a concrete, field-tested playbook you can implement right away. A strong playtesting process is not just a way to passively collect feedback, it is one of the key ingredients that separates good games from truly great ones.	brian-cronin

sol-lewitt	2	lightning	17:00	2:00	Sol LeWitt, Combinatorial Enumeration, and Rogue	"Sol LeWitt wrote that ""the serial artist does not attempt to produce a beautiful or mysterious object but functions merely as a clerk cataloguing the results of his premise.” This premise could be a set of axioms, a geometric constraint – or a roguelike level generator! From this viewpoint, the enumeration of all outputs from a procedural content system is itself a type of artwork.<br /><br /> I’ll explore this connection between 20th century conceptual art and 21st century expressive range analysis. In particular, I’ll show how we can enumerate every possible Rogue level to identify ""impossible"" room layouts."	mark-gritter
