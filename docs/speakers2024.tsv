adrian-zeyfang	Adrian		adrian-zeyfang.png	Probably Impossible: NecroDancer's network code	A technical overview of Crypt of the NecroDancer's unique approach to online multiplayer, based on the principles of rollback, while replacing the conventional frame-based timeline by a turn-based system. Bringing online multiplayer to a rhythm game in which players can directly interact with the world and each other poses many challenges that aren't typically encountered while working on other network games - all while preserving the emergent, quirky mechanics that the game's community grew to love.  This talk introduces a conventional rollback approach, then gradually shapes it into the architecture found in NecroDancer today, describing and resolving edge cases along the way. Follow the journey of how online multiplayer, a feature once dismissed as "impossible", was implemented!	Adrian Zeyfang is a game developer from Germany and founder of Vortex Buffer. While working in enterprise software development, he kept pursuing passion projects on the side. During one of those projects, a rewrite of the rhythm roguelike "Crypt of the NecroDancer" with online multiplayer and mod support, he got a bit carried away, eventually drawing the attention of Brace Yourself Games, the studio behind the game. 2 years of work later, the fan project turned into an official DLC, and Adrian's childhood dream of being a game developer came true.	probable-impossibly

Alexander will give you advice on how to structure your generation so it is easy to expand, and how to create a good test workflow so the whole team can test their content. He will also show how iterating on the level generation led to use signed distance fields for island generation to fit with the requirements for the gameplay. The talk will end with a showcase of the custom tools and workflows he has created for his team to put art and story content into the game's generation.	Alexander is a programmer and designer that has been in the games industry for 14 years and worked in both Denmark and the UK. His work features the intersection of procedural generation, graphics programming, and how to create fun and expressive workflows for devs and players alike.

adnrew-cedotal	Andrew Cedotal		placeholder.png	Literary Origins of the Rogue Archetype	Em and I were discussing the literary origins of the rogue archetype. It's reasonably well documented that the chain back from Rogue (1980) goes something like:  Rogue-->Original Dungeons & Dragons-->Fritz Leiber's Fahfrd and the Grey Mouser stories (cited in OD&D)/The Hobbit/Conan (specifically "Tower of the Elephant) (the three are roughly contemporaneous, and without research I can't tell exactly which one the genealogy runs through)-->Lord Dunsany's thief stories-->Hornung's Raffles stories-->Holmes (Doyle and Hornung were in-laws)-->Poe's Dupin stories-->???  As part of tracing this line of descent, I'd attempt to define precisely what we mean by the fantasy rogue, and then link it briefly to historical attempts to define roguelikes. Two paths that seem fruitful to investigate are:  * The notion that the fantasy rogue is defined by the architecturality of their activities (the notion of entering a specific https://sf-encyclopedia.com/fe/edifice to perpetrate theit activities), a characteristic that clearly separates them from the older and more general tradition of trickster archetypes. * The linkage of the architecturality of the fantasy rogue to the "labyrinth" in "procedural death labyrinths"  Other possible lines of inquiry include:  * Whether the notion of a particular "job" rather than general opportunistic theft helps define the fantasy rogue, making the jewel in "Tower of the Elephant" a predecessor of the Amulet of Yendor and the "Asphalt Jungle"/"Rififi"-codified heist genre a sibling of the roguelike. * Patterns in the linear-media tropes that survived adaptation to roguelikes vs. ones that didn't * The development of the rogue/gentleman-thief archetype as, like the development of the detective literary archetype, a social reaction to urbanization and anxieties about a move from a society based on tight-knit local communities to a society based on socially-atomized, market-and-law-mediated relationships (which, linking to the previous point, prioritize "jobs" over purely self-directed activity)	I'm a software product executive, former video-game studio head, and published board game designer.	literary-origins
brian-cronin	Brian Cronin	https://twitter.com/briangcronin	brian-cronin.jpeg	Block Box Sim for Roguelikes	Gameplay architecture is vital to the success of a roguelike, but it doesn't get the attention it deserves. In this session, we'll cover the "Black Box" approach to running game simulations independently from input, UI, graphics, animation, VFX, and sound.  We'll start with an overview of the benefits of rigorously separating your game logic from input and presentation. Then, we’ll dive deep into a specific implementation that has been successfully used in multiple games, both launched and in the works. We'll break down how it's been used to implement replay systems, undo systems, damage preview, save/load, and networking.  By the end, you’ll see just how powerful this approach can be for your own games.	Brian Cronin is an engineer and designer who can't stop making roguelikes! He previously spoke at Roguelike Celebration in 2021 about Monster Train, a deck building roguelike. Having started on pre-smart phone game development, he's been working on games professionally for 20 years. He works full time in the educational game space and also works on roguelikes in his free time.

This talk will explore how random elements can drive compelling plotlines without relying on predefined lore, and how diverse complications can turn failures into opportunities for narrative branching. Through practical examples and case studies, we'll explore how structured randomness can lead to emergent storytelling that surprises both players and creators alike.

courtney-liessen	Courtney		courtney-liessen.jpg	Cheating the System (By Design!) for Epic Combos	Some games are designed with player-directed "cheating" in mind, where you build up a character with broken-seeming combos that make you feel like you're exploiting the game by growing your power exponentially. The Roguelike genre, in particular, has many examples of this phenomenon, benefitting from its coolness while having the built-in counterbalance of a frequent progress reset. In this talk, I'll discuss some of the reasons why these kinds of power escalations feel so good, approaches to balancing them, how they might apply to various genres, and how to design and implement them in a way that tips the scales into "cheating" rather than just "here's a stronger weapon". Done right, players will feel like they've done something even the game's developer didn't anticipate!	I have been in the game industry for over 20 years professionally, working in key programming and design roles on games such as Halo Wars, Age of Mythology and Age of Empires, Orcs Must Die, Stranger Things 3: The Game, and as lead designer for the AIAS 2013 Mobile Game of the Year Hero Academy. Since starting as a solo developer in 2014, I've published the VR tower defense hit Evil Robot Traffic Jam as well as the Rampart homage Sky Cannoneer. I am currently working on a dream project with my Roguelite Space ARPG Reality Break, where I continue to emphasize visceral moment-to-moment fun, polished aesthetics, and long-term depth and replayability.	cheating-the-system
dan-norder	Dan Norder	https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@elflings	dan-norder.png	Chase: The BASIC Language Proto-Roguelike	In the early years of computing, a small turn-based game called Chase, built in the BASIC programming language, had players escaping robots and luring them into obstacles. It soon developed variations and enhancements as it spread to other computer systems. On the 60th anniversary of BASIC, we will examine these "robotlike" games and how the gameplay might be used in modern roguelikes.	A computer hobbyist for more than 45 years, I got started with roguelike games in 1987 with one of the first versions of NetHack.

On a high level, TRP leverages a general game playing agent (Monte Carlo Tree Search) to create a representation of a level in terms of playable and unplayable areas, then recombines playable and unplayable areas from the input level to make new ones. TRP outperforms popular approaches like WaveFunctionCollapse in terms of plagiarism and playability.  In this talk, I’ll showcase the TRP approach. I’ll delve into how the algorithm itself works, show several examples across multiple game domains, and provide comparisons against several other popular low-data level generation approaches. The talk will end with a description of how to implement TRP via an example Godot implementation, along with exploring the challenges and issues with the algorithm and the future work that aims to address these concerns.  I’m particularly excited about this approach because of both the coherency of the output levels in comparison to other low data level generation approaches and the overall elegance of the algorithm. I hope to see you there! 	Emily Halina is a PhD student at the University of Alberta researching human-centered artificial intelligence.

We'll be looking at this through the lens of "hauntology", a cultural theory that deals in cycles of nostalgia and the ghosts that it creates, and looking at how this might apply to roguelites such as Inscryption and Returnal. I promise it won't be quite as morbid as it sounds.	I am a UX and urban designer and visiting lecturer at the University of Roehampton in London.

john-bond	John Bond	https://twitter.com/kaimatten	john-bond.jpg	Doors or no Doors: How Roguelike games take you places	In a fantasy setting, we accept dragons without explanation, even though they make no sense according to the laws of physics or biology. It is also so with dungeons, so pervasive in roguelike games as to be axiomatic. Massive, livable dungeons do not exist in real life, except they do in this one spot in Central Turkey called Cappadocia, which I just so happened to visit in May 2024. Is this talk a thinly-veiled attempt at sharing a travel slide show? Maybe, but I did take an incredible amount of photos, LIDAR video and assembled significant historical notes from a variety of sources.  There are many cave cities in Cappadocia, which could hold thousands of people each. This came to be here due to particular geological and social factors. The cave cities were known to be built and maintained over thousands of years, only falling into obscurity due to another weird geopolitical move called the 1923 Population Exchange between Greece and Turkey. The narrative I want to walk the audience through here is how all these random forces seemed to conspire to create these otherwise improbable underground cities.  I am going to share several interesting architectural features of these dungeons, all in the frame of how it could inspire gameplay, including: extruded steps, dovecuts, warning tubes, rolling doors, movable ladders.  Finding information about these cave cities is interesting as well: in the first wave of the internet, lots of mom and pop websites were made. However, these are mostly 404d now, incompletely replaced with Facebook groups. Finding maps of dungeons would require me to use the internet archive to get a pdf made by a German which I would then have to Google translate. This is made harder by the fact that Greece and Turkey consider each other cultural adversaries, and since the cave cities were made by the expelled Greeks, the Turkish government isn’t particularly excited about documenting them. Thus, finding information is a quest in itself.  Overall, I hope this talk is inspiring for viscerally immersive game design.

The dispute is over Defense of the Ancients (DotA) the multi million dollar E-sports and casual play intellectual property. This contesting escalates into a multi year lawsuit in which Lilith games challenges Valve and Blizzards claim to DotA, trying to claim it as a ’collective work’, pressuring these mega companies to frantically try and establish a ’'legitimate'' claim to their intellectual property. And in the process transforming the games formerly thousands of authors into four.   All this of course being in opposition to DotA’s nature – as a collective work.  Lets dive into how Valve successfully transformed the narrative of DotA’s development to the detriment of 99% of it’s authors and community and how we can prepare ourselves for ownership heists like these.
