            <p>GitHub is dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, or level of experience. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another event participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being.</p><br/>

            <p>Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
              <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
              <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
              <li>Focusing on what is best for everyone at the event</li>
              <li>Showing empathy towards other participants</li>
            </ul><br/>

            <p>Unacceptable behavior includes:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The use of sexualzed language or imagery and sexual attention or advances</li>
              <li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
              <li>Harassment of any kind, even in a joking or ironic manner</li>
              <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
            </ul><br/>

            <p> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at this event.</p>

            <p>Each event guest is entirely responsible for his or her own actions.</p>

            <p>Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.</p>

            <h2>Reporting an Incident</h2>

            <p>To discuss any incident or behaviour in violation of this code of conduct, please contact the organizer, Lee Reilly (<a href="mailto:lee@github.com">lee@github.com</a>), or another GitHub employee or a security officer, either in person at the event or by phone or email. We will take any complaints seriously, and respond promptly and appropriately. Any person, including event staff, who violates this Code of Conduct may be asked to remedy their behaviour, apologise, leave the event, or be banned from future events.</p>

            <p>Our goal in dealing with reported incidents is to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
