            Dungeon Hacks<br/>
            <small class="header-small">with David Craddock</small>
          </h2>

          <p>To the uninitiated, roguelikes appear simple: text blips denoting monsters and legendary heroes prowl through dungeons hewn from hash signs and periods. Under the hood, these games abound with clever algorithms that ensure no two adventures will ever be the same. Dungeon Hacks author David L. Craddock plumbs depths of 10,000 feet to discuss the history of the genre—from primordial titles like Beneath Apple Manor and Rogue to contemporary classics such as NetHack and Angband, and the foundational tropes that inspire the roguelike authors of today.</p>

          <p><a href="http://davidlcraddock.com/about/">David L. Craddock</a> is
            the author of several books on game development including Dungeon Hacks, Stay Awhile and Listen, and Break Out: How the Apple II Launched the PC Gaming Revolution. Additionally, he is the author of Heritage, a fantasy novel for young adults named runner-up of the Shortlist for Speculative Fiction Book of the Year (2014) – Book Publishers Association of Alberta.</p>

            Love Letter to Nethack<br/>
            <small class="header-small">with George Moromisato</small>
          </h2>

          <p>George Moromisato will talk about his love for Nethack and how adapting its mechanics to his game, Transcendence, taught him more about game design than any course or book. Along the way he’ll speculate on what makes Nethack (and other Roguelikes) so special, and what makes them so much deeper and engaging than many big budget games.</p>

          <p>George Moromisato is an American software engineer and game designer. He’s been programming for 70% of his life and has worked at Microsoft, IBM, and Lotus Development Corporation. He is the creator of several computer games, including Anacreon (one of the first 4X games), Chron X (the first online collectible card game), and most recently, Transcendence.

            Accessibility<br/>
            <small class="header-small">with Alexei Pepers</small>
          </h2>

          <p>This talk examines how features of the roguelike
              genre relate to accessibility for visually impaired players, using
              Nethack as a case study. Several changes were made to Nethack to
              make it more accessible, and the feedback from this case study
              provides several lessons as to how roguelike games in general can be
              made more accessible, as well as what aspects of them pose the
              biggest challenges to accessibility.</p>

          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ampepers">Alexei Pepers</a> is a graduate of the University of Calgary, who is
              now working as a programmer in the games industry at Beamdog. She has
              loved Nethack since childhood and always wanted to know how it ticked,
              so in the final year of her degree conducted a research project on
              introducing accessibility for visually impaired players to Nethack,
              under the supervision of Dr. John Aycock. John Aycock is an associate
              professor at the University of Calgary, and the author of Retrogame

          <p>Levels of Rogue are virtual spaces, but also typographical grids that relate to a 1st century Latin word square, typewriters from the 19th century, concrete poetry and visual art in the 20th century, and preceding computer games. By considering the history of monospace type, character sets, and the visual arrangement of punctuation and letters, along with the ways language has been inscribed by hand, by machine, and digitally, it's possible to see new genealogies for roguelikes and new contributions these games have made.</p>

          <p><a href="http://nickm.com/">Nick Montfort</a> works in creative computing, particularly as it relates to language and text. He develops computational art and poetry, often collaboratively. He studies video and computer games, popular and obfuscated programming, digital poetry and other electronic literature, demoscene productions, and aspects of computing that are less easily classified.

            Tone and humor in dungeonmans<br/>

          </h2>

          <p>Surface-dusting Storytelling: Humor and Fiction in
              Dungeonmans. Roguelike players enjoy building their
              own fiction around the adventures of their hero, and
              this is usually encouraged by the ridiculous
              specifics and wild build customization available in
              most RLs. There's a spectrum between a blank canvas
              world where everything centers on the travels of
              your murderhobo, and a highly detailed world with
              concrete fiction such as Qud. Jim will talk about
              how you can bring more of their setting's ideas to
              life without having to dive too deeply into a
              fiction, as well as how to apply humor with enough
              subtlety as to not beat players over the head with
              it.</p>

          </h2>

          <p>The creators of Dwarf Fortress discuss the influence
              of several roguelikes on the foundation and
              continued development of the project.</p>

          <p>Tarn and Zach Adams are the co-founders of Bay 12
                Games. Their main project is Dwarf Fortress, a
                fantasy simulation game which is distributed free of
                charge and has developed a strong niche
                following. While centered around a dwarven colony
                mode, the game's adventure mode is a traditional
                roguelike roleplaying game.</p>

          </h2>

          <p>From Hobbyist to Full-time Roguelike Developer:
              Tracing my route from before I even knew what a
              roguelike was to years of exploring the genre and
              community before setting out to create a grand and
              innovative roguelike with just the right mix of
              traditional and modern features to help guide the
              genre towards a more mainstream audience without
              losing anything that makes roguelikes great.</p>

          <p>For the past three and a half years,
              <a href="https://twitter.com/gridsagegames">Josh
              Ge</a> (aka Kyzrati) has been working on Cogmind, a
              sci-fi robot-building roguelike with a focus on
              audiovisual immersion and a combination of
              procedural and handmade content. Josh has spent
              years helping other developers in the community,
              writing articles about building roguelikes, and also
              created REXPaint, a widely-used ASCII art and
              roguelike development tool.</p>

            Practical Low-Effort PCG: Tracery and data-oriented PCG authoring<br/>
            <small class="header-small">with Kate Compton</small>
          </h2>

          <p>Procedurally generated content is
              great, but writing so much custom code becomes
              unwieldy and too many great projects die tangled-up
              in long chains of if-statements.  Tracery, a popular
              and newbie-friendly generation tool, can keep data
              for procedural content generation separate from the
              gameplay code, while still generating neat stuff.
              The creator of Tracery demos a few neat tricks
              (no-hassle reskinning of RPGs and more!) and shows
              some hard-earned lessons for how keeping your data
              and code separate can make projects clean,
              maintainable, and fun to build.</p>

          <p>Kate Compton</a> is a long-time Procedural Content
              Generation (PCG) practitioner.  She wrote the first
              paper on procedural platformer levels, generated the
              planets for Spore, and wrote the latest SimCity fire
              system.  She is now a PhD candidate at UC Santa Cruz
              developing artificial intelligence to augment human
              creativity with generative art.  She likes laser
              cutting, 3D printing, artbots, twitterbots, and

              24 years commenting on particularly strange,
              enlightening, amusing and memorable events during

          <p><a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_biskup">Thomas

              creative. But they haven't found much of a home in games.
              In this talk, Jason Grinblat teaches you to build your own
              Markov text generator. He then walks through a design experiment
              in which he uses Markov text to procedurally generate in-game
              lore books for his roguelike/RPG, Caves of Qud. He explains
              how he moves beyond "just a generator" and weaves a game mechanic
              around the text generation: players can research generated
              books at an in-game library and learn meaningful secrets
              that they can act upon in the game world.</p>

          <p>Jason Grinblat is co-founder, designer, writer, and gameplay programmer
              for <a href="http://freeholdgames.com/">Freehold Games</a>,
              the tiny studio behind Sproggiwood and Caves of Qud.
              Their mission is to build imaginative games that involve
              offbeat settings, interesting tactical situations, and a
              whole lot of emergence in the tradition of the roguelike genre.</p>
