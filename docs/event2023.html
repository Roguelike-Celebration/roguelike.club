                Fictions of Infinity in Geological Finitudes

                  <p>In his fictions, Jorge Luis Borges describes the Infinite Library, an infinitely large space which contains all possible books that have ever been, and might ever be written. Procedural generation makes infinite spaces like this possible, while Roguelike game mechanics make infinite spaces like this navigable, explorable and playable. Geological conceptions of oil and plastic problematise these spaces of infinite possibilities and infinitely large time-scales. While the available time of organic beings is finite, sometimes, organic matter returns as oil or plastic- as something that is unable to die and perpetually return into our bodies as microplastics. Can roguelike game mechanics such as meta-progression, permadeath or procedurality inform new conceptions for geology, petrofictions, and nonhumans?</p>

                Another Stupid Date: Love Island as a Roguelike
                <a href="javascript:bio(9);">(more)</a>

              <div id="bio_9" class="bio hidden">
                <p>The British dating game show Love Island is as notorious as it is popular. The format involves contestants living in an isolated villa and forming heterosexual couples, with the overall winning couple at the end receiving a cash prize. In this experimental lighting talk, I will make comparisons between the design and game mechanics of Love Island and roguelikes. For example, the heavily produced nature of the show, with plotlines and archetypal characters, is much akin to a live game with a dungeon master, a format which roguelikes heavily draw upon. Furthermore, Love Island arguably contains turn-based, procedural and permadeath mechanics in how challenges, recouplings and dumplings are orchestrated.</p>
                  <p>The talk will conclude with a reflective segment on how Love Island could learn from dating roguelikes such as Boyfriend Dungeon in embracing queer relationships and discussions around consent and mental health.</p>

                Generating Procedures: Rule and System Generation for Roguelikes

                  <p>Roguelikes generate items, stories, worlds and names - but rarely rules. There's lots of good reasons not to do it - it feels weird, for one thing, and it's technically complex and unpredictable. But it can also be exciting, surprising and funny, and can lead to some amazing new challenges for players and designers alike. It's exactly the blend of generative chaos and technical creativity that people love about roguelikes. So how do you get started? Join me for a look into how generative design shapes rules, how AI can help, and why your next roguelike should design itself.</p>

                  <p>Ah Sudoku--the logic puzzle where you fill a 9x9 grid with numbers. While most sudoku are computer-generated randomly, there is a growing community of variant sudoku constructors that make beautiful and brain-bending puzzles--all by hand. Let's explore the history of "hand-crafted vs computer-generated" from the perspective of this puzzle community. We'll cover the motivation, the beauty, and the tools of the trade of hand-crafted puzzles, and show how "hand-crafted vs computer-generated" is more of a spectrum than a binary.</p>

                  <p>Join Blaseball community manager & designer Elliot Trinidad in this practical retrospective about how a simple "first name, last name" character generator was able to illicit everything from obsession to controversy in the hands of a creative community. What do procedural character names say about your game's world? How did we tune our names to better highlight cultural diversity? And just what does it look like when seemingly small decisions get constant live feedback from an invested audience? Tune in to find out!</p>

I believe this to be a first in roguelikes and in the talk I'm going to outline how the game a) procedurally generates its main categories of cryptic riddles, b) ensures that there is enough information for the player to decipher them, and c) generates and stores unique custom triggers through which they can actually be solved by performing each procedurally generated solution, and d) checks that there are enough ways to figure out the answer to a riddle, i.e. that the riddle is not unusually difficult or the riddle's key components are too rare or hard to find.</p>

                  <p>Music in roguelike games will be heard hundreds and hundreds of times over by the players, and is liable to become a bit exhausting to if not considered closely. There are techniques and decisions that can aid in creating music for your game (or directing a composer to create your game's music) that will truly augment the sense of adventure that roguelike a bring to the table. This talk is both geared towards composers AND people who work with them on games. For composers, it will shed some light on the aforementioned techniques, and for other devs it will give you the ability to effectively communicate these ideas to your composer! Everyone gets a little something with this one, so stop on by for a quick look into designing roguelike music!</p>

                The Fortunate Isles: Fragment Worlds, Walled Gardens, and the games that are played there

                <div id="bio_8" class="bio hidden">
                  <p>Every game is a fragment world– bordered by the rules of its logic. These boundaries may be spoken out loud (don’t step on the cracks! the floor is lava!) or may be programmed (the end of traversable ground, the rim of the map, an invisible wall that plays a bonk sound effect when you walk into it). Such edges, encircling, make the space of play. These worlds are defined by their boundaries– they exist floating. This talk takes as its center the concept of the walled garden, expanding it out to include games and games spaces. It looks at ornamental gardens, cloisters and isolate spaces, and even mythological or utopian fantasies of worlds apart, and seeks to connect the logic of potent isolation to the games we make and play. By examining historical narratives of boundaries, walls, and edges as applied to constructed spaces, this talk thinks about processes of worldbuilding and systems design as a methodology of gardening, with all of its attendant violences (against the slugs, yes, but also in their construction out of the world)– and looks as well beyond the boundary, where the garden stops and a wildness of bugs, errors, logical failures and edge cases begin.</p>

                Alphaman: Developing and releasing a post-apocalyptic Roguelike game in the DOS days when computers were slow, memory was scarce, and no one had ever heard of object-oriented code.

                  <p>A retrospective of the challenges and rewards of developing Alphaman, a post-apocalyptic Roguelike game for DOS back before Windows or widespread internet use.  I will talk about the challenges of programming with Microsoft QuickBasic while gearing the code for computers with 8088 microprocessors, with the intent to distribute on 3 ½” disks.  I will describe some of my motivation for the admittedly quirky aspects of Alphaman, and talk about some of the content and humor that did and didn’t stand up to the test of time after nearly 30 years.  I will also include a plug for the GitHub site where Jamie Bainbridge put the source code (he is my hero for managing to successfully recompile Alphaman after nearly 30 years.  This could provide a peek into the source code of a project that grew much larger than originally expected, requiring expanding the original clumsy QuickBasic code with QuickC modules, which themselves included embedded machine language code at places where computation speed needed to be increased.  Kids these days have it so easy!</p>

                A Simulation with a View
                <a href="javascript:bio(12);">(more)</a>
                <div id="bio_12" class="bio hidden">
                  <p>Roguelike systems are often full of rich, intricately generated environmental and historical details. Most of it is lost on players who typically navigate the world through the perspective of a single or small party of adventurers. This makes sense in terms of aligning player and character perspective in their journey.
It does, however, limit the information they have access to in terms of discovering interesting or quirky
emergent details and stories.</p>
                  <p>Our current project takes the opposite stance of exposing as much of the simulation as possible to allow players the fun of perusing and discovering the intricacies of its generated histories. This led to a series of novel design problems: how to present this massive quantity of information? And how to give players
reasons to engage with it.</p>
                  <p>In this quick talk, I will quickly explain our approaches to tackling these issues. First, I will present our Chroniqueur interface which affords players an immediate, accessible Wikipedia-like interface documenting most of the world’s simulated history. Secondly, I will touch on the Divine Affaire gameplay which positions players as higher entities responding to the needs of simulated characters. To devise wise plans of actions, they first need to investigate the simulated lives and understand the given situations. Given the complexity of the simulation, miraculous meddling does not always yield the expected results and much of the fun comes from uncovering the consequences of one’s interventions in the characters’ timelines.</p>
                  <p>The project is playable and I can show all this within the game itself.</p>

                  <p>A walkthrough of how Spry Fox designs are implemented under the hood. We've developed a text-based config library that contains a number of procedural patterns so our small design team can multiply our content efforts and maintain our game systems. In our latest project, we've added a "design dashboard" layer which lets us peer into our own game data at a higher level. I'll talk through how it works, why we like it, and where we plan to take it next.</p>

                  <p>Puzzles are a common design element in many genres - but not roguelikes. Roguelikes are designed for repitition, and a puzzle that's been solved once provides no challenge and no satisfaction on the third (or thirtieth) playthrough. In order to get around the 'curse' of repitition, Josh leans on some strategies from mathematics in order to create systems for producing puzzles that continually engage players, even across many (many) playthroughs.</p>

                Fusing AI with Game Design: Let the Chaos In

                <p>For decades, procedural systems have enabled countless games and gameplay that would otherwise be impossible or impractical. The current state of AI in games is chaotic and controversial, and yet it also has the potential to enable its own set of entirely new, otherwise impossible games. How do we explore this new frontier together?</p>
                <p>In this talk, a game designer and AI programmer from Hidden Door will discuss how they blend generative AI with traditional game design and procedural systems to build something greater than the sum of its parts. We’ll outline challenges we’ve faced combining these two disciplines and illustrate examples to show how AI can be used thoughtfully to enrich aspects of game design.</p>
