                <div class="bio">I began computer programming in college back in the DOS days, and immediately fell in love with Rogue after receiving it on a free 5 ¼” floppy disk in the postal mail.  During graduate school, I began tinkering with a post-apocalyptic game similar in feel to Rogue, and developed it slowly while working on my physics PhD at Cornell University.  With the help of play testers and encouragement from friends, I finally completed and released Alphaman in the 1990s.  A recent resurgence in interest in Alphaman, with the source QuickBasic/QuickC source code posted on GitHub by Jamie Bainbridge, and a 2-part retrospective published by John Harris, as well as subsequent feedback from many people saying that Alphaman got them into roguelike games, has motivated me to put together this talk.</div>
