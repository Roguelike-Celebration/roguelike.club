                    <p>I'd like to present to the audience a science-fiction novel named "La Horde du Contrevent" and how it actually borrows code from roguelikes, without even realising it. The fiction's universe, its story, its characters and even the way it uses the "screen" of a book has a lot in common with traditional roguelikes; while being developed absolutely independently.</p>

                  Persistence and Resistence: How narrative in roguelikes is currently underutilized

                    <p>I have always really been excited about the roguelike genre's potential as narrative vehicles! I've always thought the genre seemed incredibly well suited to telling stories about systemic change, about communities, about daily lived struggles. I'm often surprised that the genre isn't more saturated with games like this. With more popular examples of narrative driven roguelikes in recent memory like Hades, I think now is a really cool time to talk about what exactly makes roguelikes such a cool medium for these types of stories, in the hope of more people being inspired to make games like that!</p>

                    <p>Through my doctoral studies I have coined the term generative archaeology games to refer to games with procedurally generated content that a player is encouraged to interpret and record archaeologically.

                    <p>Like a lot of us, I often get an itch to create a new game, but rarely want to spend the effort <em>actually making that game a reality</em>. During the 2020 lockdown that itch struck again, so I reached for the tool closest at hand: Google Sheets. Here are some of the tricks I've learned over the last two years of making games in Google Sheets, and how you can use it to prototype all sorts of roguelike experiences.</p>

                  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Cataclysm

                  <div id="bio_9" class="bio hidden">
                    <p>Last year I created an encyclopedic guide for the deeply complex post-apocalyptic roguelike, Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Cataclysm. This talk is about how I went about making it, what the challenges and successes have been, and the reasons why I made it. So-called ‚Äúspoilers‚Äù are sometimes frowned upon or thought of as a bit dirty in the roguelike community, but our relationship with them is more complex than that. Spoilers help the player to immerse themselves, especially in simulationist games like Cataclysm. And often, spoilers are the only plausible way to win. I'll talk about the line I walk with the Guide between being a complete resource for the game's data and inadvertently giving away "surprise" content in the game. I‚Äôll also talk about the incredible open-source community that works to build and maintain the game, and why, personally, building the Guide while caring for my newborn daughter helped me to reassess my relationship with creativity and productivity.</p>

                    <p>Vibe checking with our playerbase to identify fun points and pain points, maintaining groups of superfans that see some early early content even earlier, and open chats with our players have been instrumental components of 20XX and now 30XX's development, and I'd love to dig into some of our strategies for managing and acting on (or not acting on) fan feedback specifically in the context of replayable roguelites. My relationship with 20XX/30XX's players has been a major factor in both games' success, so I'm usually pretty excited to talk about it!</p>

                    <p>I've made a lot of puzzle generators - the ones that make the puzzles for Knotwords, Good Sudoku, and Spelltower, to name a few.  It turns out there are more than a few similarities between creating  a procedurally generated puzzle, and a procedurally generated roguelike. Once myself and Zach Gage had that insight, we began to treat the problem of creating a puzzle generator for a new problem like creating the player of a roguelike.  This oppositional approach to puzzle design allowed us to create ways of assessing the difficulty of a puzzle, a framework for hints and tutorialization, and a more human approach to procedural generation.</p>

                    <p>In procgen games, we often make simulated histories, or when the player dies, have them wake up in the world a generation later as another character. My struggle was how to make world changes feel meaningful. During the deep isolation of the pandemic, I came across a model used in therapy called Internal Family Systems, a technique to view oneself as a being of several parts, each of which have their own needs.</p>
                    <p>I‚Äôve translated this notion of parts into an AI system called Concerns, where each being in the world is a body with a collection of concerns with individual weights. From this talk, my hope is we can expand our idea of how we can make simulated histories feel playable, and the implementation of AI behaviour in immersive sims, aiming for empathizable and interesting instead of optimal.</p>

And so it often happens that all kinds of different players pick them up, often hoping for a relaxing experience. This puts our team in a though spot when it comes to balancing and game difficulty.

                    <p>Roguelike games involve a huge number of random calculations, from item and level generation to damage values in combat. We love this randomness because of the excitement and variety it brings to the Roguelike genre, but it can also bring unfairness and frustration.</p>
                    <p>In this talk I'll go over some techniques I've used to 'smooth off' some of the more extreme and frustrating results randomness can provide. These adjustments can make the game experience feel much more consistent and fair without perceptibly affecting the things we like about RNG.</p>

                  Causal Graphs for Procedural Generation
                  <a href="javascript:bio(22);">(more)</a>

                    <p>Causal graphs are models that describe possible causal relationships between things. They're typically used during inference: given some source of data, how can we explain the patterns we see? This talk is about doing the opposite. Instead of using them to learn about data, we'll generate it.</p>
                    <p>This is useful because a natural-seeming choice when procedurally generating data leads to something really strange. Imagine you roll some attributes independently, say hometown and favorite food. If you look at the results in Seattle, the favorite foods end up the same as for Tokyo. There is no relationship between the attributes. In the real world scientific studies have to be careful so their results aren't undermined by selection bias. If you only survey middle aged women in Nebraska your results might not generalize. A causal graph can introduce these kinds of relationships into generated content.</p>

                      <li>Coding a simple sim to analyze an existing physical game (Mafia/Werewolf) to understand its balance and improve how it's played</li>
                      <li>Writing a bot to play a huge, sprawling visual novel game (Neo Cab) to explore every nook and cranny of the story, finding dead content, balancing the in-game economy, and fixing dead ends we didn't know we had.</li>
                      <li>Combining real user research data from thousands of playerson an in-development trivia game (Cat Burglar) with Monte Carlo techniques to translate a loose creative goal into a fine-tuned, robust difficulty curve that works for potentially millions of players at different skill levels.</li>

                  A Small Clump of Pixels: Creating the Sil-Q Tileset

                    <p>When the developer, half, forked Angband to make Sil, he made major changes to the codebase to create something elegant, thematic, and fundamentally new. Although Angband has tiles, Sil was developed without much regard for the tile display system.</p>
                    <p>I worked with Quirk to create and implement a new, custom tileset for his variant, Sil-Quirk (Sil-Q). I would like to discuss the process of creating the tileset for Sil-Q, as well as my thoughts on tilesets in general: the balance of representative vs symbolic tiles, the role of visual clarity in roguelikes, the challenges of drawing with individual pixels, the visual tools that a tileset artist has to communicate information, and the lessons I learned along the way. Finally, I would like to emphasize that my experience in creating a tileset was both enjoyable and fulfilling, and I encourage anyone interested in tilesets to try their hand at making their own.</p>

                  Telnet, a New Session, and transsexualizing the past

                    <p>In 2021, myself and my co-editor Lo Ferris published two issues of New Session, a literary magazine designed to be accessed over Telnet. In the 80s and 90s, Telnet was a technology that became synonymous with BBSs and MUDs, but has since largely been forgotten by the average computer user. The core of the motivation for New Session was to revisit the past using a specifically queer and trans lens, recasting this system outside of pure nostalgia and instead as a tool to be used for telling new stories.</p>
                    <p>Between this and the release of "Body Out Of Time", an erotic Hypercard stack, I've found old technology to be a poignant tool for reimagining the past. This talk will focus on avoiding the allure of nostalgia-for-nostalgia's sake, and how the constraints of outdated systems and aesthetics can be used as a springboard for something new.</p>

                    <p>The year is 1981, over one decade before the concept of "roguelike" would come to exist. It's the dark times of the prohibition of "rogue" (at least in the computer labs of the University of Oklahoma), and a young programming enthusiast called Robert Koeneke sets on a journey to create his very own version of the game to circumvent the interdiction. His work would ultimately become foundational for a genre of computer games, inspire many developers to build upon it, and provide endless hours of fun to thousands of players all around the world. 41 years later, Robert has abandoned this earthly plane, so let's take some time to celebrate his great contribution.</p>
