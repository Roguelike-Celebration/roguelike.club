==============

This is a captured copy of [Cover Template for Bootstrap](), included in the repo for easy local reference. Cover Template is the page template that the RLC website was initially based on. These files are not used directly by the RLC website in its current form. They're just included here as documentation and reference, for use by developers working on the RLC website code.

Downloaded from <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/cover/> on June 27, 2025. The RLC website was based on an earlier form of that template, which might differ from the files here.
